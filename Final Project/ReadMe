Hello Everyone
Here is my Final Project for my CPE 551 Python Course at Stevens Institute of Technology

Project Description:
From python code I would like to make a game. It will have the following requirements:
As you know the snake game where the snake gets bigger as you eat the apple. My game is like that but in reverse. 
Essentially there will be three choices for the users at the home screen Easy, Medium, Hard.
- Easy level: Snake is 15 ft long and will get 1 ft smaller when the snake eats an apple. 
- Medium level: Snake is 25 ft long and will get 1 ft smaller when the snake eats an apple.
- Hard level: Snake is 35 ft long and will get 1 ft smaller when the snake eats an apple.
I will have the snake's length size shown in the upper right corner of the screen and have it be updated to the snakes new length. 
As it eats an apple and when the snake is out of length it will say "You Won Congrats!" 
If the snake hits the wall it is game over for player and if the snake crashes into itself it is also game over.
Whenever the player loses, a Game Over You Lost screen will appear and users will have the choice to play again.
User will also have the choice to play again even if they have won.
